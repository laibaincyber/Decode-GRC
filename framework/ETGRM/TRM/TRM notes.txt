TRM  (Technology and Operations Risk Management Framework) NOTES 

-Developed by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
-Be integrat with ETGRM 
-Based on international standards and best practices.
-Mandatory for PSOs, PSPs, EMIs, and other regulated entities.
-Full compliance deadline: December 31, 2025.

Core Objectives

-Manage technology, outsourcing, and digital fraud risks.
-Strengthen cybersecurity and operational resilience.
-Integrate with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) practices.

Governance Requirements

-Establish a Technology Risk Management Framework (TRMF).
-Form a Board IT Committee.
-Appoint a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
-Implement board-approved policies (e.g., InfoSec, AI/ML risk, fraud management).

Cybersecurity Controls

1-Inventory Management – Document all assets and dependencies.
2-Identity & Access Management – Use MFA, role-based access, and session control.
3-Network Security – Deploy SOC, SIEM, anti-malware, and network segmentation.
4-Security Testing – Perform annual VA/PT and secure code reviews.
5-Data Security – Encrypt data; protect PII and card data (PCI-DSS compliance).
6-Patch & Change Management – Timely patching with testing.
7-Incident Response – Notify stakeholders and SBP; conduct post-incident analysis.
8-API Security – Enforce strong authentication and integrity measures.

Fraud Risk Management

-Monitor, detect, and respond to digital financial fraud.

Implement:
-Device fingerprinting
-OTP protections
-Limit device registrations
-Real-time fraud trend analysis

Safeguard customer data from misuse by staff or third parties.

Outsourcing Guidelines

-Prior SBP approval needed for material outsourcing.
-Conduct risk-based assessments of third parties.
-Include strict contractual clauses (service levels, data confidentiality, exit strategy).
-Avoid concentration risk or single point of failure scenarios.

Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BCP/DR)

-Develop and test BCP annually; include cyber threat scenarios.
-Set up DR site in a different seismic zone.
-Conduct semi-annual DR drills.
-Ensure compliance with RTO (e.g., 2 hours for Tier-1 PSOs) and RPO.

Technology Audit

-Create a risk-based audit plan.
-Conduct annual independent audits of systems, services, and implementations.

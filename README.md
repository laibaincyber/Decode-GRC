# Decode-GRC
I will be helping in decoding GRC frameworks one to one step manually
1. FOUNDATION 
What is GRC — and how Governance, Risk & Compliance interrelate
GRC vs Security vs Audit
Organizational roles (CISO, Compliance Officer, Risk Manager, Auditor)
Internal Controls, Policies, Procedures, Standards, Guidelines
Governance Structures: Committees, RACI Matrix, Escalation paths

Learn From:

“Introduction to GRC” (Mastermind / ISACA / Coursera / YouTube – Hailey GRC or GRC Academy)

🧱 2. GOVERNANCE (The “G” in GRC)

Understand how organizations are structured and governed.

Cover:

Corporate Governance Principles (OECD)

IT Governance — COBIT 2019 (ISACA)

Roles of Board, Risk Committee, and CISO

Policy Lifecycle Management (Draft → Approve → Communicate → Enforce → Review)

Documentation hierarchy:

Policy → Standard → Procedure → Guideline


Key Frameworks:

COBIT 2019

ISO 38500 (Corporate Governance of IT)

ITIL 4 (Service Governance aspects)

NIST 800-100 (Information Security Handbook)

⚖️ 3. RISK MANAGEMENT (The “R”)

This is the backbone of GRC.
You must understand how to identify, assess, treat, and monitor risks.

Cover:

Risk Management Lifecycle (Identify → Assess → Treat → Monitor → Review)

Risk Appetite, Tolerance, and Threshold

Inherent vs Residual Risk

Qualitative vs Quantitative Assessment

Risk Register Creation

Control Design and Effectiveness Testing

Core Frameworks & Standards:

ISO 31000:2018 — Risk Management Principles & Guidelines

NIST 800-30 — Risk Assessment Guide

COSO ERM Framework

FAIR Model — Factor Analysis of Information Risk (for quantitative risk)

ISO 27005 — Information Security Risk Management

OCTAVE, TARA (Threat Assessment & Remediation Analysis)

Tools (Free/Popular):

Excel-based Risk Registers

OpenFAIR Toolkit

RiskLens (FAIR modeling)

SimpleRisk (Free GRC tool)

🧩 4. COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT (The “C”)

Understand how to ensure your organization follows internal & external requirements.

Cover:

Compliance vs Regulatory vs Contractual requirements

Mapping controls to multiple frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR)

Control Frameworks & Evidence Collection

Compliance Lifecycle: Plan → Implement → Assess → Report → Maintain

Non-Compliance impact (fines, brand damage)

Major Compliance Frameworks:

Domain	Framework/Standard
General InfoSec	ISO 27001:2022, NIST CSF, SOC 2
Risk	ISO 31000, COSO
Data Privacy	GDPR, HIPAA, PDPA, CCPA
Cloud	CSA CCM, ISO 27017, ISO 27018
Financial	SOX, PCI DSS
AI / ML	ISO 42001 (AI Management System)
Industry-specific	NERC CIP (Energy), FISMA (Govt), FedRAMP (Cloud)
🔐 5. SECURITY FRAMEWORKS (MUST-KNOW MAPPINGS)

A GRC expert should know how frameworks overlap and map together.

Cover:

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)

ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls (Themes: Org, People, Physical, Tech)

CIS Controls v8 — Technical control mappings

PCI DSS — Payment Card compliance requirements

SOC 1 / SOC 2 — Trust Service Criteria

COBIT 2019 — IT Governance integration

Mapping Example:
NIST CSF → ISO 27001 → CIS Controls → SOC 2 (understand equivalence)

🧮 6. AUDIT & ASSURANCE

You’ll need to understand internal and external audit cycles.

Cover:

Audit Types: Internal, External, Compliance, Technical

Stages of Audit: Planning → Fieldwork → Reporting → Follow-up

Control Testing (Design vs Operating Effectiveness)

Evidence Collection & Sampling

Audit Findings: Severity, Risk Rating, Remediation Plans

SOC 2 Audit Reports (Type 1 vs Type 2)

Gap Analysis and Continuous Improvement

Key Standards:

ISO 19011 — Guidelines for Auditing Management Systems

ISACA IT Audit Manual

IIA Standards (Institute of Internal Auditors)

PCI DSS Audit Procedures

NIST 800-53A — Assessment of Security Controls

🧰 7. GRC TOOLS (Familiarize Yourself)

📊 8. METRICS, REPORTING, & DASHBOARDS

Know how to turn controls into business metrics.

Cover:

Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Control Effectiveness Score

Compliance Heatmaps

Residual Risk Dashboarding

Executive GRC Reporting (Board-level Summaries)

Tools: Power BI, Excel Dashboards, ServiceNow GRC Reporting, Kibana (for visualizing control status).

🧠 9. DOCUMENTATION & POLICY WRITING

A GRC analyst must write and review documentation effectively.

Documents You Should Know:

Information Security Policy

Acceptable Use Policy

Data Classification Policy

Access Control Policy

Risk Management Policy

Incident Response Policy
